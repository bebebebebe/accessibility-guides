# Accessibility Journeys

As awareness about digital accessibility grows, teams start to ramp up on best practices. Then they write a blog post about their journey. This is a round up of (mostly) engineering team blog posts about getting started with and improving accessibility practices.

## Lessons Learned
Key takeaways from all these stories:
* Address accessibility as **early** as possible, in the design stage before dev work begins.
* Involve **real users** with different sets of abilities in user testing and consulting during design.
* Develop **empathy**: for example, try out assistive technologies and watch people using them.
* Make developers feel **ownership**.

The last one is not something anyone has written in any of these posts. However, I believe that it is a key takeaway from reading them: these are mostly articles written by developers in engineering blogs, and the fact that they feel enough ownership to write such a post says a lot about why their companies have more accessible products. This matches observations I've made on my team as well -- but that's another post!
